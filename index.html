        hello, this is my personal domain.<br>
        :)<br><br><br><br>
        life is such a long road<br>
        some people walk together<br>
        some alone<br>
        some worse<br>
        appear to be close<br>
        but far apart in their heart<br><br>
        being accompanied is transitory<br>
        everlasting how loneliness is<br><br>
        depressed?<br>
        grief?<br>
        come on<br>
        everyone feels it<br>
        rarely do they care<br><br>
        not everything will be all right<br>
        not everything will flow<br><br>
        but still<br>
        you have to keep walking on the road, don't you<br><br>
        so why not hide everything and pretend to be ok?<br>
        at least it looks not that bad<br>
        what else could you expect?
